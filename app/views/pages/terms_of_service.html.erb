</p>

</p>
<p>
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Spreadsong is capable of finding and verifying its existence;

</p>
<p>
  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon Receipt of a Bona Fide Infringement Notification
</p>
<p>
  Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is Spreadsong's policy:
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to remove or disable access to the infringing material;
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to notify the Content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that for repeat offenders, Spreadsong will also terminate such Content provider's, member's or user's access to the Classicly Service.
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent If the Content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the Content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

</p>
<p>
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statement that the Content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and
</p>
<p>
  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the Content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the Content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Spreadsong is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
</p>
<p>
  ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removal
</p>
<p>
  If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Spreadsong may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Spreadsong's discretion.

  18. GENERAL PROVISIONS
</h3>
<p>
  These Terms (and the documents incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Spreadsong and govern your use of the Classicly Service (including without limitation the Classicly Site and the Classicly Apps), superseding any prior agreements between you and Spreadsong (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms). These Terms and the Classicly Service contemplated hereunder are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Spreadsong's prior written consent. Spreadsong may assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without your consent. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other Spreadsong services, third-party Content or third-party software.

You and Spreadsong agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Seattle, Washington. The failure of Spreadsong to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Classicly Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
