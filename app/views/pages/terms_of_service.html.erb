<p>
  ‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon Receipt of a Bona Fide Infringement Notification
</p>
<p>
  Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is Spreadsong's policy:

<p>
  ‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to remove or disable access to the infringing material;
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  ‚óè&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent If the Content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the Content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:
