    %h1 Privacy Policy
    %h2 Last Updated 6/9/2011
    %h3 Your privacy is critically important to us. At Spreadsong we have a few fundamental principles:
    %ul
      %li We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your income level for no apparent reason).
      %li We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop and improve our products and service offerings, or protect our rights.
      %li We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
      %li In our online services, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
    %p Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

    %p If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="mailto:support@spreadsong.com">support team</a>.

    %p Spreadsong, Inc. (“<strong>Spreadsong</strong>”) operates the website classicly.com, and the apps Free Books for iPhone, Free Audiobooks for iPhone, Classicly for iPhone, Audibly for iPhone, Free Books for iPad, Free Audiobooks for iPad, Browser+ HD, and Browser+ for iPhone. It is Spreadsong’s  policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

    %h2 Website and App Visitors
    %p Like most website and app operators, Spreadsong collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, iOS devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, the date and time of each visitor request.  Spreadsong’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Spreadsong’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Spreadsong may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

    %p Spreadsong also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and hardware identifiers of iOS devices. Spreadsong only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

    %h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    %p Certain visitors to Spreadsong’s websites and apps choose to interact with Spreadsong in ways that require Spreadsong to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Spreadsong gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 

    %p For example, we ask visitors who register for Classicly to connect with Facebook, to better provide identify users between applications, give great book recommendations, contact via email from time to time, and display more relevant advertising.

    %p In each case, Spreadsong collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Spreadsong. Spreadsong does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website and app-related activities.

    %h2 Aggregated Statistics
    %p Spreadsong may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Spreadsong may monitor the most popular books on the Free Books for iPhone app to improve browsing or find which books are most popular with different demographics, to better recommend books throughout our services. Spreadsong may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Spreadsong does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

    %h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    %p Spreadsong discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Spreadsong behalf or to provide services available at Spreadsong’s websites and apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Spreadsong’s websites and apps, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 
    %p Spreadsong will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Spreadsong discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Spreadsong believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Spreadsong, third parties or the public at large. 
    %p If you are a registered user of a Spreadsong website or app and have supplied your email address, Spreadsong may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Spreadsong and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs and in-app notifcations to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Spreadsong takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

    %h2 Cookies
    %p A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Spreadsong uses cookies to help Spreadsong identify and track visitors, their usage of Spreadsong website, and their website access preferences. Spreadsong visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Spreadsong’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Spreadsong’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

    %h2 Business Transfers
    %p If Spreadsong, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Spreadsong goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Spreadsong may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

    %h2 Ads
    %p Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Spreadsong and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

    %h2 Privacy Policy Changes
    %p Although most changes are likely to be minor, Spreadsong may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Spreadsong’s sole discretion. Spreadsong encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change
